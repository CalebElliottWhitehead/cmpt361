## About

For this project, I wanted to make a well architected webgl application using object oriented programming. This is from the lecture on object oriented graphics programming and the lecture on scene graphs. I wanted to make my own simple THREE.js library. This was also partly in response to the super confusing code in the book and partly in defence of JavaScript. I wanted to show a good way of writing a decently constructed application using many of the new JavaScript features. All the code is my own including the math functions.

### Part 1

I decided not to use the starter for this. Instead, I took the opportunity to show off my own scene library. You can also move the camera with right mouse button and zoom with the scroll wheel. Clicking will reset the camera.

### Part 2

The scene I decided to make was a tree. The tree is generated recursively from a few parameters. You can try generating a few more trees by refreshing the page. I kept my shader very simple because that was not my focus for this assignment. You can move the camera with the right mouse button, reset with the "r" key, and zoom with the scroll wheel.

## How-To

I developed it in Firefox 68 but it should run in any browser that is up to date.
Again, it is very important that the browser is the latest release.
