## How to play

Use arrow keys to move
Use left mouse button to shoot
r to restart and q to quit

## Additional Features

- There is an ammo counter on the bottom left corner
  - You get 5 shots and you get to choose the best way to use them
  - The bullets reload every 0.75 seconds from the moment of shooting
- Dead entities show a shadow where they were killed
  - Also shows off the collision
- Enemy movement uses a cosine function
  - This makes the game more fun by making the enemy movement predictable while still being random
  - This makes it difficult to tell if the enemies speed up as they approach the buttom but they do
- I implemented my own shader compiling for educational purposes so there is no dependencies
